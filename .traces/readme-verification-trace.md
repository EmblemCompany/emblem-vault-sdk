## File Analysis

<details>
<summary>readme.md (line 1 of 306)</summary>

The readme.md file serves as the primary documentation for the Emblem Vault SDK. It includes information about installation, initialization, and various SDK functions. This analysis will verify each section against the actual implementation in the codebase.

### Table of Contents
The readme.md includes a comprehensive table of contents that covers:
- Installation
- Initialization
- Fetching Curated Contracts
- Creating a Vault
- Refreshing Vault Balance
- Validating Mintability
- Performing a Mint
- Utility Functions
- Example Usage

This structure appears to be well-organized and covers the main functionality of the SDK.

### Installation Section
The readme states two methods of installation:
1. Including the `bundle.js` file in an HTML file
2. Installing via npm with `npm install emblem-vault-sdk`

Both methods are valid, but the npm installation method could be more detailed with version information.

### Initialization Section
The readme shows initialization with:
```javascript
const sdk = new EmblemVaultSDK('demo');
```

This matches the constructor in `index.ts` which requires an API key as the first parameter, with optional parameters for baseUrl, v3Url, and sigUrl.

</details>

<summary>readme.md (line 30 of 306)</summary>

### Fetching Curated Contracts Section
The readme describes fetching curated contracts with:
```javascript
sdk.fetchCuratedContracts(false).then(curatedContracts => {
    // Use the curated contracts
});
```

Verification:
- ✅ The `fetchCuratedContracts` method exists in `index.ts` (line ~54)
- ✅ It takes a boolean parameter `hideUnMintable` (default: false) and an optional `overrideFunc` parameter
- ✅ It returns a Promise with curated contracts data
- ✅ The implementation sorts contracts by name and applies templates to each item

### Creating a Vault Section
The readme shows creating a vault with:
```javascript
let contractTemplate = {
    fromAddress: null,
    toAddress: null,
    chainId: 1,
    experimental: true,
    targetContract: {
        "1": "0x345eF9d7E75aEEb979053AA41BB6330683353B7b",
        "5": "0x582699d2c58A38056Cf02875540705137f0bbbF7",
        name: "Bitcoin DeGods",
        description: "Bitcoin DeGods is a collection of 535 Bitcoin Ordinals inscribed in the 77236 to 77770 range. This collection is curated by Emblem Vault."
    },
    targetAsset: {
        image: "https://emblem.finance/btcdegods.jpg",
        name: "Loading...",
        xtra: "anything else you need here"
    }
};

vaultData = await sdk.createCuratedVault(contractTemplate, updateLogCallback);
```

Verification:
- ✅ The `createCuratedVault` method exists in `index.ts` (line ~80)
- ✅ It takes a template object and an optional callback function
- ✅ The template structure matches what's expected by the implementation
- ✅ The method uses `templateGuard` to validate the input
- ✅ It returns a Promise with the vault data

## Comprehensive Documentation Discrepancies Summary

Based on the verification of the readme.md against the current codebase, here are the key discrepancies and recommendations for updating the documentation:

1. **Missing Functions and Methods**:
   - **Bitcoin-related Functions**: 
     - `generateTaprootAddressFromMnemonic(phrase: string)` and `getPsbtTxnSize(phrase: string, psbtBase64: string)` from `derive.ts` are not documented
     - These functions provide important Bitcoin functionality that should be included in the readme

   - **V3 API Methods**: 
     - Several V3 API methods are not documented (`fetchVaultsByQueryV3`, `fetchVaultsByAddressV3`, etc.)
     - These methods provide alternative ways to interact with the V3 API and should be included in the readme

   - **Asset Metadata Functions**: 
     - Functions for working with asset metadata (`getAssetMetadata`, `getAllAssetMetadata`, etc.) are not documented
     - These functions provide important functionality for working with asset metadata and should be included in the readme

   - **Placeholder Functions**: 
     - `generateUploadUrl()` is mentioned in the readme but appears to be just a placeholder in the code
     - This function should either be implemented or removed from the readme

2. **TypeScript Types and Interfaces**:
   - **Type Definitions**: 
     - The readme does not include any information about the TypeScript types and interfaces defined in `types.ts`
     - The data structures returned by the API are not documented
     - The readme should include a section on TypeScript types and interfaces

   - **Type Safety**: 
     - The SDK uses TypeScript, but the readme examples are in JavaScript
     - The readme should mention TypeScript support and provide TypeScript examples

3. **Bitcoin Functionality**:
   - **Bitcoin Operations**: 
     - The readme does not mention the Bitcoin-specific functionality provided by the SDK
     - The dependencies required for Bitcoin operations are not documented
     - The readme should include a section on Bitcoin functionality

   - **PSBT Operations**: 
     - The SDK provides functions for working with Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions
     - These functions are not well-documented in the readme
     - The readme should include more information about PSBT operations

     - The examples in the HTML files demonstrate UI integration that is not covered in the readme
     - The readme should include more information about UI integration and user feedback

   - **Collection-specific Workflows**: 
     - The examples in the HTML files demonstrate simplified workflows for specific collections
     - These workflows should be mentioned in the readme as alternative approaches

   - **Multiple Vault Creation**: 
     - The example in `index.html` demonstrates creating multiple vaults in sequence
     - This functionality should be mentioned in the readme

   - **CSV Data Generation**: 
     - The example in `index.html` demonstrates generating CSV data from vault information
     - This functionality should be mentioned in the readme

5. **API Documentation**:
   - **API Endpoints**: 
     - The readme does not provide detailed information about the API endpoints used by the SDK
     - The readme should include more information about the API endpoints and their parameters

   - **Error Handling**: 
     - The readme does not provide detailed information about error handling
     - The readme should include more information about error handling and error codes

6. **Dependencies and Requirements**:
   - **Browser Requirements**: 
     - The SDK requires a browser environment for some functionality
     - The readme should mention browser requirements and compatibility

   - **External Dependencies**: 
     - The SDK depends on several external libraries
     - The readme should list all dependencies and their versions

## Recommendations for Documentation Updates

1. **Add Missing Functions**: Add documentation for all missing functions and methods, including Bitcoin-related functions, V3 API methods, and asset metadata functions.

2. **Add TypeScript Types**: Add a section on TypeScript types and interfaces, including examples of how to use them.

3. **Expand Bitcoin Documentation**: Add a section on Bitcoin functionality, including address generation, PSBT operations, and dependencies.

4. **Add UI Integration Examples**: Add examples of UI integration and user feedback, based on the examples in the HTML files.
