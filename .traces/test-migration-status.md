# Emblem Vault SDK Test Migration Status

## Overview

This document captures the current state of the Emblem Vault SDK test migration from Jest to Mocha/Chai, including our progress, implementation patterns, and remaining work.

## Migration Journey

### Initial State

The Emblem Vault SDK originally used Jest for testing with the following characteristics:
- Tests were located in the `/tests` directory
- 18 test suites covering various collection types
- Mixture of unit tests and integration tests in a single directory
- No clear separation between test types
- Limited memory leak detection capabilities
- Test fixtures scattered across multiple directories

### Current State

We have successfully migrated to a Mocha/Chai testing framework with:
- Restructured test directory at `/test` (vs. original `/tests`)
- Clear separation between unit and integration tests
- Dedicated directories for fixtures, helpers, and utilities
- Improved memory leak detection with ResourceMonitor
- Override function pattern for better testability
- Maintained backward compatibility with legacy Jest tests

## Key Implementation Patterns

### 1. Override Function Pattern

The SDK now implements a consistent override function pattern across API methods:

```typescript
async methodName(param: string, callback: any = null, overrideFunc: Function | null = null) {
  // Allow callback for progress tracking
  if (callback) { callback('operation in progress') }
  
  // Override pattern
  const result = overrideFunc 
    ? await overrideFunc(this.apiKey, { param })
    : await fetchData(`${this.baseUrl}/endpoint`, this.apiKey);
    
  return result;
}
```

This pattern enables:
- **Testing**: Makes unit testing easier by allowing mock data injection
- **Flexibility**: Enables alternative implementations for different environments
- **Extensibility**: Consumers can provide custom data sources or caching mechanisms

### 2. Test Organization

Tests are now organized following these principles:
- Initialize SDK once per describe block
- Group related tests together
- Skip tests conditionally when using demo keys
- Use proper timeout settings for API calls

```javascript
describe('Feature Group', () => {
  let sdk;
  
  before(() => {
    sdk = new EmblemVaultSDK(API_KEY);
  });
  
  it('should test specific functionality', async () => {
    // Test-specific mock data
    const mockData = [...];
    
    // Test implementation
    const result = await sdk.someMethod();
    expect(result).to.have.property('expectedProperty');
  });
});
```

### 3. Memory Leak Detection

We've implemented a robust ResourceMonitor utility that:
- Takes memory snapshots before and after operations
- Calculates memory differences
- Checks against configurable thresholds
- Generates detailed reports
- Supports garbage collection when available

### 4. Module Import Handling

We've addressed TypeScript and CommonJS/ESM integration issues:
- Compile TypeScript code before testing
- Use proper import patterns for compiled modules
- Handle named exports correctly
- Use source maps for debugging

## Migration Progress

2. **Collection Tests** (All Completed):
   - AllowedBells.spec.js
   - AllowedBitcoinDeGods.spec.js
   - AllowedBitcoinOrdinals.spec.js
   - AllowedCounterparty.spec.js
   - AllowedCursedOrdinals.spec.js
   - AllowedEmbells.spec.js
   - AllowedEmbels.spec.js
   - AllowedEmblemOpen.spec.js
   - AllowedEthscriptions.spec.js
   - AllowedHardcodedNfts.spec.js
   - AllowedNamecoin.spec.js
   - AllowedOrdi.spec.js
   - AllowedOxbt.spec.js
   - AllowedProtocolCollection.spec.js
   - AllowedStamps.spec.js

3. **Metadata Tests**:
   - DarkfarmsMetadata.spec.js

4. **Integration Tests**:
   - ApiOperations.spec.js - Read-only API operations
   - VaultCreation.spec.js - Vault creation operations
   - VaultAI.spec.js - AI-related functionality

5. **Infrastructure**:
   - Test directory structure
   - Mocha configuration
   - Test helpers and utilities
   - Fixture management

### New Test Areas

1. **Provider Abstraction Tests**:
   - Providers.spec.js - Tests for the blockchain provider abstraction
   - Tests for provider registration, detection, and usage
   - Tests for Web3ProviderAdapter and Solana provider integration

2. **AI Integration Tests**:
   - VaultAI.spec.js - Tests for AI-powered vault information retrieval
   - Tests for API key handling and URL configuration
   - Tests for response processing and error handling

### Remaining Work

1. **Signing Tests**:
   - Tests for the new `performMintHelper` method (currently a stub)
   - Tests for transaction signing with different provider types
   - Tests for message signing with different provider types

2. **Documentation**:
   - Update SDK documentation to reflect the new testing approach
   - Add examples of using the override function pattern
   - Create migration guides for contributors

## Migration Strategy

For each remaining test area, we follow this migration process:

1. **Analysis**: Review the existing code to understand its purpose and structure
2. **Fixture Migration**: Move fixtures to the appropriate directory in `/test/fixtures`
3. **Test Conversion**: Convert assertions to Chai assertions
4. **Override Implementation**: Update tests to use the override function pattern
5. **Validation**: Ensure tests pass with both real API calls and mock data
6. **Documentation**: Update the README.md to reflect the migration status

## Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Module Import Issues

**Challenge**: TypeScript modules with named exports caused import issues in CommonJS tests.

**Solution**: 
- Compile TypeScript to JavaScript before testing
- Use proper destructuring for named exports
- Maintain consistent import patterns

### 2. Memory Leak Detection

**Challenge**: Detecting memory leaks reliably across different environments.

**Solution**:
- Created ResourceMonitor utility with configurable thresholds
- Implemented proper garbage collection triggers
- Added detailed memory usage reporting

### 3. API Key Management

**Challenge**: Securely using API keys in tests without exposing them.

**Solution**:
- Use environment variables for API keys
- Skip tests when using demo keys
- Add conditional test execution based on API key availability

### 4. Provider Abstraction Testing

**Challenge**: Testing provider abstraction without actual blockchain providers.

**Solution**:
- Created detailed mock providers for Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin
- Implemented sinon stubs for provider methods
- Used the adapter pattern to test provider conversions

## Next Steps

1. **Signing Implementation**:
   - Implement the `performMintHelper` method to replace `performMintChain`
   - Add tests for signing operations with different provider types
   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing code

2. **Continuous Integration**:
   - Update CI configuration to run Mocha tests
   - Add coverage reporting for all tests
   - Implement parallel test execution for faster feedback

3. **Documentation**:
   - Update SDK documentation to reflect the new provider abstraction
   - Add examples of using different provider types
   - Create migration guides for users of the SDK
