# Emblem Vault SDK Test Migration Status

## Overview

This document captures the current state of the Emblem Vault SDK test migration from Jest to Mocha/Chai, including our progress, implementation patterns, and remaining work.

## Migration Journey

### Initial State

The Emblem Vault SDK originally used Jest for testing with the following characteristics:
- Tests were located in the `/tests` directory
- 18 test suites covering various collection types
- Mixture of unit tests and integration tests in a single directory
- No clear separation between test types
- Limited memory leak detection capabilities
- Test fixtures scattered across multiple directories

### Current State

We have successfully migrated to a Mocha/Chai testing framework with:
- Restructured test directory at `/test` (vs. original `/tests`)
- Clear separation between unit and integration tests
- Dedicated directories for fixtures, helpers, and utilities
- Improved memory leak detection with ResourceMonitor
- Override function pattern for better testability
- Maintained backward compatibility with legacy Jest tests

## Key Implementation Patterns

### 1. Override Function Pattern

The SDK now implements a consistent override function pattern across API methods:

```typescript
async methodName(param: string, callback: any = null, overrideFunc: Function | null = null) {
  // Allow callback for progress tracking
  if (callback) { callback('operation in progress') }
  
  // Override pattern
  const result = overrideFunc 
    ? await overrideFunc(this.apiKey, { param })
    : await fetchData(`${this.baseUrl}/endpoint`, this.apiKey);
    
  return result;
}
```

This pattern enables:
- **Testing**: Makes unit testing easier by allowing mock data injection
- **Flexibility**: Enables alternative implementations for different environments
- **Extensibility**: Consumers can provide custom data sources or caching mechanisms

### 2. Test Organization

Tests are now organized following these principles:
- Initialize SDK once per describe block
- Group related tests together
- Skip tests conditionally when using demo keys
- Use proper timeout settings for API calls

```javascript
describe('Feature Group', () => {
  let sdk;
  
  before(() => {
    sdk = new EmblemVaultSDK(API_KEY);
  });
  
  it('should test specific functionality', async () => {
    // Test-specific mock data
    const mockData = [...];
    
    // Test implementation
    const result = await sdk.someMethod();
    expect(result).to.have.property('expectedProperty');
  });
});
```

### 3. Memory Leak Detection

We've implemented a robust ResourceMonitor utility that:
- Takes memory snapshots before and after operations
- Calculates memory differences
- Checks against configurable thresholds
- Generates detailed reports
- Supports garbage collection when available

### 4. Module Import Handling

We've addressed TypeScript and CommonJS/ESM integration issues:
- Compile TypeScript code before testing
- Use proper import patterns for compiled modules
- Handle named exports correctly
- Use source maps for debugging

## Migration Progress

### Completed Migrations

1. **Core SDK Tests**:
   - EmblemVaultSdk.spec.js - Core SDK functionality
   - ResourceMonitor.spec.js - Memory leak detection utility
   - SDKMemoryLeaks.spec.js - Comprehensive memory leak tests

2. **Collection Tests**:
   - AllowedCounterparty.spec.js - Counterparty collection tests

3. **Integration Tests**:
   - ApiOperations.spec.js - Read-only API operations
   - VaultCreation.spec.js - Vault creation operations
   - VaultAI.spec.js - AI-related functionality

4. **Infrastructure**:
   - Test directory structure
   - Mocha configuration
   - Test helpers and utilities
   - Fixture management

### Remaining Migrations

The following Jest tests still need to be migrated to Mocha/Chai:

1. **Collection Tests**:
   - AllowedBells.test.ts
   - AllowedBitcoinDeGods.test.ts
   - AllowedBitcoinOrdinals.test.ts
   - AllowedCursedOrdinals.test.ts
   - AllowedEmbells.test.ts
   - AllowedEmbels.test.ts
   - AllowedEmblemOpen.test.ts
   - AllowedEthscriptions.test.ts
   - AllowedHardcodedNfts.test.ts
   - AllowedNamecoin.test.ts
   - AllowedOrdi.test.ts
   - AllowedOxbt.test.ts
   - AllowedProjectlCollection.test.ts
   - AllowedProtocolCollection.test.ts
   - AllowedStamps.test.ts

2. **Metadata Tests**:
   - DarkfarmsMetadata.test.ts

## Migration Strategy

For each remaining test, we follow this migration process:

1. **Analysis**: Review the Jest test to understand its purpose and structure
2. **Fixture Migration**: Move fixtures to the appropriate directory in `/test/fixtures`
3. **Test Conversion**: Convert Jest assertions to Chai assertions
4. **Override Implementation**: Update tests to use the override function pattern
5. **Validation**: Ensure tests pass with both real API calls and mock data
6. **Documentation**: Update the README.md to reflect the migration status

## Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Module Import Issues

**Challenge**: TypeScript modules with named exports caused import issues in CommonJS tests.

**Solution**: 
- Compile TypeScript to JavaScript before testing
- Use proper destructuring for named exports
- Maintain consistent import patterns

### 2. Memory Leak Detection

**Challenge**: Detecting memory leaks reliably across different environments.

**Solution**:
- Created ResourceMonitor utility with configurable thresholds
- Implemented proper garbage collection triggers
- Added detailed memory usage reporting

### 3. API Key Management

**Challenge**: Securely using API keys in tests without exposing them.

**Solution**:
- Use environment variables for API keys
- Skip tests when using demo keys
- Add conditional test execution based on API key availability

## Next Steps

1. **Prioritized Migration Plan**:
   - Focus on the most frequently used collection tests first
   - Migrate tests with the most coverage value
   - Address tests with known failures last

2. **Continuous Integration**:
   - Update CI configuration to run both Jest and Mocha tests
   - Add coverage reporting for Mocha tests
   - Implement parallel test execution for faster feedback

3. **Documentation**:
   - Update SDK documentation to reflect the new testing approach
   - Add examples of using the override function pattern
   - Create migration guides for contributors

4. **Future Improvements**:
   - Add more comprehensive integration tests
   - Implement contract-based testing
   - Add performance benchmarks
   - Expand fixture coverage

## Conclusion

The migration to Mocha/Chai has significantly improved the testability, organization, and reliability of the Emblem Vault SDK tests. The override function pattern has made the SDK more flexible and easier to test, while the clear separation of unit and integration tests has improved the development workflow.

We continue to maintain backward compatibility with the legacy Jest tests while gradually migrating all tests to the new framework.
