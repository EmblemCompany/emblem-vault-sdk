# Task ID: 9
# Title: Configuration Management Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create an interface for managing SDK configurations and environments.
# Details:
Develop a UI for creating, editing, and switching between different SDK configurations (e.g., development, staging, production environments). Include form validation for configuration parameters. Implement preset configurations for common scenarios and the ability to import/export configurations. Ensure compatibility with the configuration options supported by the built SDK in the docs folder.

# Test Strategy:
Test configuration switching to verify SDK behavior changes appropriately. Validate form inputs and test import/export functionality with various configuration formats. Verify that configurations work correctly with the built SDK.
