# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 5, 9

# Description: Integrate documentation and contextual help throughout the toolbox interface.
# Details:
Incorporate the parsed documentation into the UI with contextual help for each method and parameter. Create a searchable documentation browser within the toolbox. Add tooltips and hints for UI elements. Include a getting started guide and tutorials for common workflows using the SDK. Leverage the documentation available in the docs folder alongside the built SDK.
