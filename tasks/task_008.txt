# Task ID: 8
# Title: Error Handling and Debugging Tools
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop comprehensive error handling and debugging capabilities for the toolbox.
# Details:
Implement error catching and display for SDK method execution. Create a dedicated error console that shows detailed error information, stack traces, and potential solutions. Add the ability to log method calls and responses for debugging. Include links to relevant documentation for common errors. Ensure compatibility with the error formats from the built SDK in the docs folder.

# Test Strategy:
Deliberately trigger various error conditions to verify proper error catching, display, and suggested resolutions. Test logging functionality for accuracy with the built SDK.
