# Task ID: 4
# Title: State Management Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a state management system to handle toolbox configuration and session data.
# Details:
Implement a state management solution (using native JS or a lightweight library) to handle user preferences, active SDK configuration, method history, and session persistence. Include functionality to save/load configurations and export test cases. Store state in localStorage where appropriate for persistence between sessions.

# Test Strategy:
Verify state persistence across page reloads, test state updates from different components, and ensure proper initialization of state on first load.
