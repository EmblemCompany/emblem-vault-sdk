Key endpoints include:\n- GET /api/analyze - Triggers analysis and returns status\n- GET /api/results - Returns current analysis data\n- POST /api/config - Updates analysis parameters\n\nThe interactive UI features:\n- Force-directed graph visualization of SDK component relationships\n- Searchable/filterable component explorer with syntax highlighting\n- Dependency chain visualization for selected components\n\nAnalysis results can be exported in multiple formats (JSON, CSV, HTML report) with a single-click download option that includes timestamps and analysis configuration metadata.\n\nError handling includes graceful recovery from parsing failures with detailed logging, progress indicators during long-running analyses, and automatic retry mechanisms for network-related failures when fetching external dependencies.\n</info added on 2025-05-05T07:17:40.335Z>",
