# Task ID: 7
# Title: Real-time Feedback and Result Visualization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement real-time feedback mechanisms and result visualization for SDK operations.
# Details:
Create components to display method execution results in appropriate formats (JSON, tables, graphs where relevant). Implement real-time updates for long-running operations. Add copy-to-clipboard functionality for results and generated code snippets. Consider adding visual indicators for performance metrics. Ensure compatibility with the response formats from the built SDK.

# Test Strategy:
Test with various result types to ensure proper visualization. Verify real-time updates for asynchronous operations and validate the accuracy of displayed information from the built SDK.
