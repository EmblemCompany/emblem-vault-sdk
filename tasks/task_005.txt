# Task ID: 5
# Title: SDK Method Explorer Component with Direct SDK Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create an interactive component for exploring and testing SDK methods using the built SDK available in the docs folder.
# Details:
Develop a component that displays SDK methods organized by category, allows selection of methods, displays parameter inputs dynamically based on method signature, and provides a way to execute methods with the provided parameters. Include syntax highlighting for code examples and results using a library like Prism.js or highlight.js. Directly integrate with the built SDK from the docs folder to enable live method execution within the explorer component.

# Test Strategy:
Test with various SDK methods to ensure proper parameter rendering, method execution, and result display. Verify that all method categories are accessible and that the SDK integration works correctly with the built SDK from the docs folder.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Import and analyze SDK structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Import the SDK from the docs folder and analyze its structure to identify methods, categories, and parameter signatures.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a utility module to import the SDK from the docs folder
2. Implement functions to extract method information (name, category, parameters, return type)
3. Create a data structure to organize methods by category
4. Add JSDoc parsing capability to extract parameter descriptions if available
5. Implement error handling for SDK import failures

Testing approach:
- Verify all SDK methods are correctly identified and categorized
- Test with mock SDK objects to ensure robust parsing
- Validate parameter extraction accuracy for different method signatures

## 2. Create SDK method category navigation component [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Build a navigation component that displays SDK methods organized by category and allows users to select methods.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a sidebar/navigation component with expandable categories
2. Implement category grouping based on the SDK structure analysis
3. Add method listing under each category with clear naming
4. Implement selection state management for active method
5. Add search/filter functionality to quickly find methods

Testing approach:
- Test UI rendering with various category structures
- Verify selection state updates correctly
- Test search functionality with different queries
- Ensure responsive design works on different screen sizes

## 3. Implement dynamic parameter input form generation [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2
### Description: Create a component that dynamically generates input forms based on the selected method's parameter signature.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a form generator component that takes method parameter definitions
2. Implement appropriate input types based on parameter types (string, number, boolean, object, etc.)
3. Add validation for required parameters and type checking
4. Support complex parameter types with nested form fields
5. Implement form state management with default values

Testing approach:
- Test form generation with various parameter signatures
- Verify validation works correctly for different input types
- Test handling of complex nested objects
- Ensure form state updates properly

## 4. Build SDK method execution and result display [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.3
### Description: Implement functionality to execute selected SDK methods with provided parameters and display results with syntax highlighting.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create an execution service that calls SDK methods with user-provided parameters
2. Implement error handling for method execution failures
3. Create a result display component with syntax highlighting using Prism.js or highlight.js
4. Add copy-to-clipboard functionality for results
5. Implement execution history tracking

Testing approach:
- Test method execution with various parameter combinations
- Verify error handling displays meaningful messages
- Test syntax highlighting for different result types
- Ensure execution history is properly maintained

## 5. Integrate components into unified SDK Explorer interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2, 5.3, 5.4
### Description: Combine all components into a cohesive SDK Explorer interface with responsive design and user experience enhancements.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create main SDK Explorer container component
2. Implement layout with resizable panels for navigation, parameter input, and results
3. Add code example generation showing how to use the selected method
4. Implement state persistence (localStorage) to remember last used methods
5. Add loading states, error boundaries, and user guidance tooltips

Testing approach:
- Test overall component integration and state management
- Verify responsive design works across devices
- Test state persistence across page reloads
- Conduct usability testing to ensure intuitive workflow
