Emblem Vault SDK Development Toolbox

Overview:
Create a comprehensive development toolbox for the Emblem Vault SDK that allows developers to explore, test, and interact with SDK functionality in a structured way.

Goals:
1. Provide an intuitive interface for SDK exploration and testing
2. Enable rapid prototyping of SDK features
3. Facilitate understanding of SDK capabilities
4. Support both development and debugging workflows

Key Features:

Phase 1: Research & Discovery
- Code analysis to identify all SDK endpoints and methods
- Documentation parsing to understand usage patterns
- Test case analysis for implementation examples
- Identification of key SDK components and their relationships

Phase 2: Mock UI Development
- Create basic layout structure
- Implement component placeholders
- Design interaction patterns
- Establish state management approach

Phase 3: SDK Integration
- Connect SDK methods to UI components
- Implement real-time feedback
- Add error handling
- Enable configuration management

Technical Requirements:
- HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript implementation
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Clear separation of concerns between UI and SDK logic
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- Support for different SDK configurations

Success Criteria:
- Developers can easily explore SDK functionality
- Real-time feedback on SDK operations
- Clear documentation integration
- Intuitive navigation between features
- Proper error handling and user feedback
